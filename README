==========

Export the system clipboard as a file. Ideally it would be a character
device but I don't think it would be a good idea to connect to an X11
server from kernel space. Instead I've used FuseFS. Although the clipboard
is not (in this case) a filesystem but just a file. We could turn it into
a filesystem if we would like the clipboard to be a ring-like structure
like in Emacs. Or mantain a per app clipboard history.
